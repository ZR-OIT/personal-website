					<h4 class="project-heading">Embedded Junior Project -<br>Electronic Directory Board</h4>
					<p class ="about-me-paragraph">The embedded junior project at Oregon Tech is a team-based project that includes designing and buidling an embedded system to solve a particular problem. Myself and three others decided to build an electronic directory board to keep track of classroom and lab schedules.</p>
					<p class ="about-me-paragraph">Why a directory board? Many students need to use classrooms or labs outside of their scheduled course times. However, these rooms could be occupied by a professor and/or their students at any given time, so awkward interruptions can happen when walking into a room to use the equipment.</p>
					<p class ="about-me-paragraph">With an electronic directory board posted in the main lobby, students and professors could easily see which rooms are open for use by looking at the status LEDs. With a combination of a pre-programmed schedules and motion sensors, the directory can show if rooms are open or booked as well as if anyone is currently in the room.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="/img/animated-purvine-directory.gif" alt="A simple animation showcasing how the electronic directory works">
						<figcaption>A simple animation I made to show how the electronic directory works.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p class ="about-me-paragraph">Once we had the idea, we researched and compared many different components including microcontrollers, shift registers, power supplies, and LEDs. We eventually decided to use the ESP32 Arduino because it was low-cost and had built in Wi-Fi. With all the parts chosen, I made basic schematics in Microsoft Visio to show how the circuits are assembled.</p>
					<figure>

					</figure>
					<p class ="about-me-paragraph">As soon as we had the parts in our hands, we tested everything individually before assembling the circuits. It was important to make sure that all LEDs, shift registers, and motion sensors functioned as expected, otherwise we would have a hard time debugging later on. Aside from an issue with some loose wires, the circuitry went together and worked well without much trouble. An Arduino UNO was used for testing since we were already familiar with it.</p>

					</figure>
					<p class ="about-me-paragraph">While working on the circuitry, we also had to get the web server up and running on the ESP32. Initially, another team member was tasked with building the website and server. However, the team member was struggling to make substantial progress, so I took over the web server development and moved them over to designing a housing. After a long weekend, I got a simple website implemented that could control the hardware.</p>

					</figure>
					<p class ="about-me-paragraph">A library called <a href="https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer" target="_blank">ESPAsyncWebServer</a> was used to implement the web server logic. The HTML and CSS files were flashed to the non-volatile memory of the ESP32 using <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/storage/spiffs.html" target="_blank">SPIFFS</a>. The HTML files are altered before they are served to the user based on the current day and time. We also had to consider multiple people logging into the website at once, so we captured the IP of the first authorized user and prevented other logins until the first authorized user disconnects. There was dicussion of implementing this system in the building, but COVID-19 forced the campus to close.</p>
					<h4 class="project-heading">Embedded Senior Project -<br>Bluetooth OBD-II diagnostic tool with touchscreen</h4>
					<p class ="about-me-paragraph">The embedded senior project at Oregon Tech is a solo project. I struggled to come up with an idea at first, but eventually decided on building a Bluetooth OBD-II diagnostic tool with a touchscreen. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics" target="_blank">OBD-II</a> diagnostic tool is used to interface with vehicles to diagnose check engine lights or to obtain data such as temperatures, pressures, speed, and RPM.</p>
					<p class ="about-me-paragraph">I wanted to build this tool for a couple different reasons; primarily because I have always liked working on cars. I also wanted to learn more about schematic capture, the CAN bus, Bluetooth, and Raspberry Pi/Linux development. On top of that, I wanted to design and 3D print a housing, so I created prototype renders in SketchUp. The entirety of this project was developed in a remote environment during the peak of the pandemic, so access to lab equipment and other resources was limited.</p>

					</figure>
					<p class ="about-me-paragraph">Before I could start making schematics and building the circuitry, I had to research the OBD-II specifications and the different components I would need to interface with the port. I determined I would use the ELM327 OBD interpreter IC with an ESP32 to interface with the OBD-II port, and a Raspberry Pi 4 for the handheld unit. I chose the ELM327 because it is widely supported and well documented.</p>

					</figure>
					<p class ="about-me-paragraph">With help from the ELM327 datasheet, I made schematics for the OBD-II port module and the handheld module using KiCAD. I also created symbols for ICs that were not included with KiCAD. For development of the OBD-II transceiver, I planned to use Visual Studio Code with the official <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html" target="_blank">ESP-IDF extension</a> from espressif to write in C/C++. The handheld device would use Python scripts for the GUI and Bluetooth data transfer.</p>

						<figcaption>The schematic for the handheld touchscreen transceiver module.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p class ="about-me-paragraph">With the schematics made, I could begin incrementally assembling and testing the circuitry. First, I tested all components individually to make sure they were within tolerance and/or functioned correctly, including LEDs, resistors, and a button. Then, I added all the components needed for power delivery. I wanted to make sure that the 12VDC from the car battery was being reduced to 5V and 3.3V properly before adding other components.</p>

					</figure>
					<p class ="about-me-paragraph">Once the rest of the OBD-II transceiver circuit was assembled, I used an oscilloscope to make sure the 3.3V and 5V logic level translation was working correctly (the ESP32 uses 3.3V logic while the ELM327 uses the older 5V logic.) Once I was sure everything worked as expected, I tested the circuit on the car with a wired serial connection before attempting Bluetooth communication.</p>

					</figure>
					<p class ="about-me-paragraph">With the circuitry assembled, I started working more on the handheld Raspberry Pi module. Previously, I researched many different ways to power the Pi, and eventually decided on a uninterruptable power supply (UPS) hat. Using this method, the Pi could safely shutdown automatically when the battery voltage dropped too low, and the rechargeable battery would last at least 2 hours.</p>
					<figure>

						<figcaption>The Raspberry Pi 4 powered by the UPS hat.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p class ="about-me-paragraph">Initially, I decided to use default Raspberry Pi OS, but later switched to the Lite version after realizing I did not need everything that was included with the default version. I also had to make some minor tweaks to the OS to allow the button to turn the Pi on and off, as well as to allow a GUI on the Lite version of Raspberry Pi OS.</p>
					<p class="about-me-paragraph">At this point, the end of the academic year was approaching, and I still didn't have Bluetooth data transfer or a GUI. Using the examples included in the Arduino IDE, I tested to see if the ESP32 would even connect to the Raspberry Pi with Bluetooth. The connection worked, but it was just a connection with no data transfer. I also got started on the general layout of the user interface using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/" target="_blank">PySimpleGUI</a>.</p>

					</figure>
					<p class ="about-me-paragraph">I presented my project as it was, demonstrating the communication with the car through a wired serial connection. There was enough functionality and progress made to consider the project a success, but it still didn't live up to my expectations.</p>

					</figure>
					<p class="about-me-paragraph">Looking back, the project was a overly ambitious given the circumstances including working remotely with limited resources, struggling with mental health, and having to stay on top of other courses. I wanted to design and build circuits, design and 3D print housings, implement Bluetooth logic on two different platforms, design and build a touchscreen user interface, and more - all on my own within 9 months. However, I still learned a lot of useful things over the course of the project including researching and comparing components, schematic capture, how the OBD-II port and CAN bus work, how Bluetooth works, and developing on Linux/Raspberry Pi.</p>
					<h3 class="about-me-heading">Personal Projects</h3>
					<h4 class="project-heading">This Website</h4>
					<p class="about-me-paragraph">I built my first website in 8th grade for an introductory web design class using Adobe Dreamweaver. Since then, I have always had some interest in web development and have worked on several different sites for myself and others, including the Favell Museum's <a href="https://favellmuseum.org/" target="_blank">website</a> which I built in WordPress with some custom HTML and CSS. I wanted to build this site for two reasons: to test and expand my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and to have a place to showcase my work. I built this site from the ground up using Visual Studio Code and the Live Server feature. All HTML and CSS that I wrote is public domain and available on my <a href="https://github.com/ZR-OIT/personal-website" target="_blank">GitHub</a> - you are free to use the source as a template for your own site!</p>
