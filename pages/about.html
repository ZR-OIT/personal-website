					<h3 class="about-me-heading">About me</h3>
					<p class="about-me-paragraph">My interest in computers and electronics began in middle school when the family computer stopped working. We couldn't afford a new one at the time, so I had two options: find a way to fix it, or go without it. My mom wasn't enthusiastic about letting me try, but I insisted.
					</p><p class="about-me-paragraph">After hours of Googling and tinkering with the machine, I determined that the hard drive had failed and a new one with a fresh copy of Windows would get it up and running again. It worked, and although it seems like a small victory, this kickstarted my interest in computers and how they work under the hood.
					</p><p class="about-me-paragraph">Outside of computer hardware and programming, I find myself bouncing around from hobby to hobby and trying new things. At one moment I could be learning a game engine top to bottom and trying to make a game, and the next I could be outside trying to learn kickflips on my skateboard. Right now I really enjoy skateboarding, shooting, gaming, and 3D printing. 
					</p>
					<h3 class="about-me-heading">Education</h3>
					<p class="about-me-paragraph">I grew up in a small Oregon town called Tillamook, famous for the cheese and ice cream, where I graduated from Tillamook High School in 2015. I received a scholarship to attend the local community college, where I chose to pursue a basic associate's degree in science. After a couple weeks, I decided that community college wasn't right for me, and eventually applied to the Oregon Institute of Technology.
					</p>
					<p class="about-me-paragraph">I began classes at Oregon Tech in the fall of 2017 in pursuit of a B.S. in Computer Engineering Technology. At the time, I didn't know if I was more interested in software or hardware, so CET seemed to provide a great mix of both. As a first generation college student, it was hard to adjust to a new environment hundreds of miles from home while working as many hours as my schedule allowed.
					</p><p class="about-me-paragraph">The end of my junior year was approaching when the COVID-19 pandemic swept the world, and suddenly every course went online and remote. Not only was I at the most challenging point in my degree, including junior and senior projects, I was even more isolated from the world and began to really struggle with my mental health. Unforunately, I failed an upper-level computer architecture class and was set back another year. However, when classes resumed in-person the following year, I was able to finish strong and receive my degree in June of 2022.

					<p class="about-me-paragraph">My work history began when I was 15 years old, saving to buy my first car. I worked at the Tillamook Cheese Factory until I graduated high school, which is when I decided to move on to a local lumbermill. During my time at the lumbermill, I decided I wanted to join the U.S. Navy. I excelled on the ASVAB and was offered a contract in Nuclear Engineering. When my flight to basic training was approaching, I ended up being disqualified due to a previous doctor visit for a long-lasting headache.</p><p class="about-me-paragraph">Devasted, I returned to Tillamook and went back to work at a family friend's gas station while I got back on my feet. Soon after, I ended up back at the lumbermill until it was time to move to Klamath Falls. Once in Klamath Falls, I quickly found a job at a local museum to help cover my expenses. I also worked side jobs on-campus for most of my time at Oregon Tech.	
					</p><p class="about-me-paragraph">My work experience may seem all over the place, but it is mostly from starting young and still trying to decide what I want to do. In reality, I have always been a dependable and valuable employee, and my story brings it all together. Although I have no experience in fields relating to my degree, I have learned something of value from every job I have had such as customer service, team communication, attention to detail, and more.
